# PeerPouch

Implementing an adapter for PouchDB that proxies to a remote PouchDB instance over WebRTC, for particularly peer-to-peer replication!

Currently especially broken, as I just yoinked it from within [a branch of PouchDB](https://github.com/natevw/pouchdb/tree/webrtc) itself (which was never quite necessary).
